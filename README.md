## **About the Game**  
An endless block puzzle game, where you try to score as high as possible by packing the grid full of blocks! Rearrange the blocks in the grid to fit new pieces and get new high scores! Good luck!

### **Features**:
- Minimalistic design and simple controls.  
- Colour coded blocks with set sizes, to allow for optimal selection when choosing which block to pick up next.
- Gameplay: A gain of 1000 points for each fully filled in grid, and a penalty of 300 points for each reroll used.

---

## **Gameplay and Controls**  
- **Objective**: Fill the grid entirely with the blocks provided, and use rerolls if no given blocks can fit.
- **Movement**: Use WASD to move the cursor around, and K to pick up, place and rearrange the objects in the grid.
